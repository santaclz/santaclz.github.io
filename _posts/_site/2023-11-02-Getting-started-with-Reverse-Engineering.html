<h1 id="how-it-started">How it started</h1>

<p>This is a blog post about how I started in reverse engineering and exploit development field. It’s not a guide on how to get started just my path and experience. The year was 2020 and I was playing CTF with a friend. There was a reversing challenge which I wanted to solve so badly I ended up skipping sleep. I didn’t solve it in the end but I stepped into a whole new world of reversing. After that CTF I decided to study more for reversing challenges. Up until that point I was solving mostly web and cryptography challenges on hackthebox and cryptohack. My study plan was to move from category to category mastering every field. After getting reality checked by many CTFs I realized that all categories are hard and there is no point at which you master one. So instead of mastering every category I decided to focus on just one which I considered the coolest (pwn). Over time I got rusty at the other ones but I tell myself it’s okay since I found my passion. Later I decided to look at real world vulnerabilities instead of CTF challenges.</p>

<p>I gave a talk on Linux Kernel Exploitation at BSidesLjubljana and I learned how to write Windows Kernel exploits. I also got opportunities to attend multiple big conferences and travel the world. Currently I’m learning macOS internals.</p>

<p>In 2021 I decided to create my own programming language. I called it OogaBooga and its syntax is inspired by C language. At the time I didn’t know anything about compilers. I spent hours with pen and paper deciding on how to implement things. I probably reinvented many things but I got very comfortable with assembly at that point. Even though assembly knowledge was 5% of the project I understood how code abstractions work at a much more detailed level. After 3 weeks of dedicating my entire energy to that project I got my first “Hello World” program compiled from my language and executed on the CPU.</p>

<p>Here is the link to the project: https://github.com/santaclz/OogaBooga</p>

<p>Later I also created a gdb inspired debugger together with my friends on college: https://github.com/AlexBrence/FERIdebugger</p>

<p>This is my heap implementation to understand heap exploitation: https://github.com/santaclz/myheap</p>
